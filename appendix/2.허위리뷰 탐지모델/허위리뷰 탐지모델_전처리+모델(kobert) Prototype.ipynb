앉아서 기다리면 된답니다 대표 메뉴가 보이는 곳에 전시되어 있어 메뉴 선택에 도움이 됐어요 입구에 적힌 위로의 말이 마음에 위안을 주었습니다 잘했어 잘했었고 잘할거야 내부는 사람들로 가득 찼지만 웨이팅을 피해 자리를 잡을 있었습니다 원산지 표시를 확인하니 묵은지 대부분의 재료가 국내산이라 믿음직스러웠어요 점심특선 메뉴가 아주 저렴해서 점심에 방문하기에 좋은 곳이란 생각이 들었어요 네이버 사진 리뷰 작성 음료나 볶음밥을 받을 있는 팁도 알게 되었습니다 우리는 곱도리탕 뼈닭 한우대창과 곱창 모둠 보통맛으로 주문했습니다 라면사리와 공깃밥 하이볼과 소주도 함께 주문했죠 기본 반찬으로 나온 단무지와 두부가 단순하면서도 맛있었고 하이볼의 비주얼도 인상적이었습니다 숙주와 팽이버섯이 푸짐하게 올려진 전골은 보글보글 끓는 모습이 매력적이었어요 처음 맛본 곱도리탕은 양념이 배어서 맛있었고 흑미밥이 특히 인상 깊었습니다 볶음밥은 숙주와 팽이버섯을 추가해 먹으니 더욱 맛있었습니다 곱도리탕 경험이었지만 고추장과 간장 베이스의 소스 덕분에 입문하기 좋았고 부드러운 닭고기가 인상적이었습니다 건대 맛집으로 인정받는 이유를 같았어요 50 77년생 곱도리 전골식당 서울특별시 광진구
